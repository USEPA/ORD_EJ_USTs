## Scripts to run EJ analysis

## List of scripts with brief notes:

**01_InstallPackages.R**
Run this script first to make sure you will have all of the necesarry libraries to run the tools that all of the scripts will require.

**02_EJ_data_prep.R**
This script will clean all of the input data needed for the various analyses. 

**05_Exposure_Ratios.R**
If you want to save the spatial versions of tracts and/or MSAs, you will need
to download a spatial file to do so. In our case we used the 2019 version
of Census tracts and MSAs obtained from NHGIS.org
